novy_doc - automatically write the header documentation.

This program is used by the other Novy programs

To generate header documentation

USAGE
  ./novy_doc.sh OPTIONS > NEWFILE
  However, you shouldn't use it like this. It should be done while
  using novy_c or novy_java. So any options used in those programs will
  be passed to novy_doc.sh
  
  NOTE: This program DOES NOT use JavaDoc style documentation...yet.

FILE OPTION
  These options apply to the files attributes.  For all options, including 
  the book options later in this section, it is recommend that you put
  any values in between double quotes ('"') so that they are recognized as a single
  argument, other wise you will encounter errors or the output will be incorrect.

  file-name FILENAME		-fn FILENAME
  	Creates a File field for the name of this file. This option is required.
	All other options are optional.

  file-version VERSION		-fv VERSION
  	Create a Version field.

  file-date DATE		-fd DATE
  	Create a Date field that uses a date other than
  	the one provided by fecha[string] in .novyrc.
	If you do not use this option, the Date field will automatically be added
	anyway as part of a standard header unless the 'nofile' option is used.
	To change the format of the date used, edit fecha[format] in .novyrc.

  file-author NAME		-fa NAME
  	Create a Name field that uses a name other than
	the one provided by self[name] In .novyrc.
	If you do not use this option, the Name field will automatically be added
	anyway as part of the standard header unless the 'nofile' option is used.
	
  file-author-email EMAIL	-fae EMAIL
  	Create a Email field that uses an email address other than
	the one provided by self[email] In .novyrc.
	If you do not use this option, the Email field will automatically be added
	anyway as part of the standard header unless the 'nofile' option is used.
	For your security, any '@' or '.' characters will be replaced.
  
  file-website URL		-fw URL
  	Create a Website field that is used to indicate the 
	website of the author, a project, or a company.

  file-requirements FILELIST	-fr FILELIST
	Create a Requirements field that is used to indicate what software
	is required for this program to work effectively.

  file-info	INFO		-fi INFO
  	Information about a file.  This would be suitable for a 
	brief description in five words or less,
	otherwise, you will want to write the complete information inside the file.
	Even if you do not use this option, the Info field will automatically be added
	anyway as part of the standard header unless the 'nofile' option is used.

BOOK/EXAMPLE OPTION
  Many people copy examples from books for practice.
  If you are required to cite your sources, or if you just want to keep track of
  the examples you are trying out in a book, you should use these fields.
  If you need to cite your sources in a certain writing style, this program will NOT
  put infomration into a certain writing style.  However, if you do need help doing
  that, my I suggest you check out the following websites for the following styles:

   MLA: https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/
   APA: http://www.apastyle.org/

  Only the field that are fille out will appear in the header documentation
  unless the 'nobook' option is used.
  All your vales for these fields MUST be encapsulated in double quotes
  for proper processing.

  book-title TITLE		-bt TITLE
   	Create the Title field for the title of a book.

  book-author AUTHOR		-ba AUTHOR
   	Create the Author field for the author of a book.

  book-publisher PUBLISHER	-bp PUBLISHER
   	Create the Publisher field for the publisher of a book.

  book-publisher-location LOCATION	-bpl LOCATION
   	Create the Location field for the publisher's main office location.

  book-edition EDITION		-be EDITION
  	Create the Edition field for the edition of a book.

  book-year YEAR		-by YEAR
  	Create the Published field for the year the book was published.
	If you want to add the month or day of the source, especially
	if it was from a magazine, newspaper, or website that you accessed,
	be sure to include that.

  book-isbn ISBN		-bi ISBN
  	Create the ISBN field to indicate the ISBN number of the book or printed source.
	Eventually entering in this field will automatically insert the data
	for the previous fields, when and if I find a way to store book information
	into a local database for storage of common books. (new_book.sh?)
  
  book-website URL		-bw URL
  	Create a Website field indicating the URL this example/figure 
	can be found on or the website of the author, publisher, or book.

  book-website-accessed DATE	-bwa DATE
  	Because websites can change addresses, change structures, or close, it is a good
	idea to indicate when you accessed this site to verify your source was legitimate.
	This option creates the Accessed field indicating the date in which you last
	access that site.

  book-figure FIGURE		-bfn FIGURE
  	Create the Figure field to indicate the figure number from a book.

  book-page PAGENUM		-bfp PAGENUM
  	Create the Page field to indicate the first page that a figure is on
	or where the example is in the book.

SWITCH OPTION
	These options will disable a set of fields even if information
	has been entered in for them.

  noself
  	Don't use the 'self' fields from .novyrc that enter in your name and email address.

  nodate
  	Don't use the 'fecha' field from .novyrc that enters in the date 
	and applies date formats to date fields.

  nofile
  	Don't use ANY of the file fields other than the Name field.
  nobook
  	Don't use ANY of the book fields.

  help		--help		-h
  	Print this usages information.  This option only works if it is the ONLY option.
