== DISCLAIMER ==
Novy and its related programs does not send data online, unless you are running
this program online like on a webserver or a website like Koding.com.
At any rate, no data will be transfered elsewhere, ever.
Any data that is use is stored locally for your use only, and will
only be stored on the .newrc file this script was meant to create.
If this program is altered to do such a thing, stop using it
immediately and contact me, Jason Charney (jrcharneyATgmailDOTcom)
indicating that a forged version of this program is trying use your
data or ask more personal questions like bank accounts or social security
numbers.  THIS PROGRAM WILL NEVER ASK THOSE QUESTIONS!

As for any other problems, I'm not responsible if anything breaks or other
disasters caused by you or some act of God or ghost in the machine.
I will take constructive criticism and ideas for how to improve stuff.
However, if you made a dud program or it didn't "wow" the people you impressed
that's on you.  I can't impress anyone anymore than I can change the weather.
So if something goes bad, it wasn't because you used my programs but
more than likely you did something that wasn't supposed to happen or
you probably abused this program.

At any rate, fixing this program, or customizing it, should be easy. YMMV.
If there was any part of this disclaimer you did no catch, read DISCLAIMER.txt.
By using this script you agree to use my programs properly and not abuse them.

TLDR: Make sure this script is real, and don't make programs that could
	ruin your life through a series of unfortunate events.
